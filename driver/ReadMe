The little project is trying to complish a character driver.
The Steps are:
	1. Initialize the setting of the driver and insert into the modules.

The Bugs met:
	1. "No operation permission"
	    insmod function must be operated in "root"
	2. "Required key not avaliable"
	    it means your computer is in uefi mode and the modules can only be used with "certificate"
	    "EFI_SECURE_BOOT_SIG_ENFORCED" enabled.We can make the certificate for the module, or we can change the BIOS settings.
	    command:
                    sudo apt-get install mokutil
		    sudo mokutil --disable-validation 
 	    it will ask you to create a 8-16 password. Do it and reboot the computer. Then the computer will enter the MDK manage interface.
	    Enter the password as the request and then change the Secure State into "NO". It will be cured.
