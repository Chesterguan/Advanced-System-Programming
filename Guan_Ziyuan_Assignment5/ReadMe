=   Assignment <5>         =
============================
Files Contained:
----------------------------
1. char_driver.c  // the main program
2. Makefile
3. userapp
4. ReadMe
============================
How To Run The Program:
----------------------------
1. Use the Command [Ctrl + T ] to open the terminal
2. Use the Command [make] to compile the char.driver.c files and get the executable objects
3. Use the Command [sudo insmod char_driver.ko NUM_DEVICES=<number of devices>] to define and insert the driver moduler.
4. Use the Command [lsmod] to check whether the module has been inserted or not.
5. Use the Command [make app] to compile userapp.c
6. User the Command [sudo ./userapp <device No.>] to test the program
7. Use the Command [sudo rmmod char_driver.ko] to remove the driver.
8. During the process, you can also use the Command[dmesg] to check the kernel message
9. The Function of the char_driver contains: Read, Write, Lseek, Icotl, Release and Clean
============================
Results:
----------------------------
1. Satisfy the requests of the assignments and Checked with userapp.c
2. Solved the bugs and upload to github: www.github.com/Chesterguan/Advanced_System_Programming
