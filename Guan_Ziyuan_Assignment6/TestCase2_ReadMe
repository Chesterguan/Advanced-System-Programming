TestCase2:
1. In this case, the device is opened from main
2. There are three threads, Thread0, Thread1, Thread2
3. Thread0 and Thread1 operate on the file that was opened by the main thread, Thread1 tried to use ioctl for mode 2 and Thread 0 tried to use ioctl for mode 1.
4. Both of them could process since only one file is needed to open for ioctl to occur. All threads are not able to proceed and a deadlock occurs.
