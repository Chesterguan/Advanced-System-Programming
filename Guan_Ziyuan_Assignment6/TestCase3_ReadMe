TestCase3:
1. The device file is opened (Mode 1) from main thread
2. The mode is changing to mode 2 using ioctl
3. Another file is opened in the main thread and right now the mode is 2.
4. There are two threads Thread0 and Thread1 which share the same buffer.
5. Thread0 operates on one file(fd=3) while Thread1 operates on the other file(fd=4).
6. Thread1 acquires the lock first and copied the string from global buffer and write it to the device.
7. Then we can change mode to 1 by ioctl but it failed since count2 is bigger than 1 so Thread 1 sleeps.
8. Thread0 is processes then, it tried to acquire the lock so it could read form the device and copy to the buffer. However, the lock is already held, ddeadlocks happen.
